metafinal
=========

The aim of my final year project was to create a metasearch engine capable of aggregating and clustering result sets 
obtained using the Google, Bing and Blekko Search APIs. To perform the aggregation I implemented reciprocal rank fusion 
aggregation using the quick-sort algorithm. To perform clustering I implemented the K-means algorithm. Both these 
methods were coded using php. I used JavaScript to provide an interactive frontend for users to view results. 
The metasearch engine also includes limited query expansion by way of a thesauras lookup using the api provided 
by http://words.bighugelabs.com/ .The finished product may be viewed at csserver.ucd.ie/~05433070
